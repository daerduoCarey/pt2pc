# PT2PC: Learning to Generate 3D Point Cloud Shapes from Part Tree Conditions (ECCV 2020)

![Overview](https://github.com/daerduoCarey/pt2pc/blob/master/images/teaser.png)

**Figure 1.** We formulate the problem of Part-Tree-to-Point-Cloud (PT2PC) as a conditional generation task which takes in a symbolic part tree as condition and generates multiple point clouds with shape variations satisfy the structure defined by the part tree.

## Introduction
This paper investigates the novel problem of generating 3D shape point cloud geometry from a symbolic part tree representation. In order to learn such a conditional shape generation procedure in an end-to-end fashion, we propose a conditional GAN "part tree"-to-"point cloud" model (PT2PC) that disentangles the structural and geometric factors.

## Dependencies

Please run
    
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt

to install the dependencies.

Please also install

        cd sampling
        python setup.py install
        cd ..
        cp sampling/build/lib.linux-x86_64-3.6/sampling_cuda.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so .

## Quick Start

Download [pretrained models](http://download.cs.stanford.edu/orion/pt2pc/pretrained_ckpts.zip) and unzip under the root directory.

Then, you can visualize the generation results using Jupyter Notebook `quick_test.ipynb`.

## To train the model

Simply run

        python ./train.py --category Chair

## HierInsSeg Scores

Check the README in `hierinsseg`. This is our proposed structure reconstruction metric.
